## Comparing Classes and Structures

Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:
* Define properties, methods, subscript, initializers
* Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
* Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:
* Inheritance & Type casting
* Deinitializers to free up any resources it has assigned.
* Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

/*:
### Classes Are Reference Types
Reference types are copied when they are assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a function. Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance is used instead.

### Structures and Enumerations Are Value Types
A value type is a type whose value is copied when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function.
